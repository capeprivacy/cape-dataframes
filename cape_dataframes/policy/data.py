"""Contains the policy classes that are initialized from a yaml policy file.

There are five main classes with Policy being the top level class. Policy contains
the PolicySpec and NamedTransformations. PolicySpec contains Rules and Rules
contain Transformations.

    Typical usage example:

    yaml_str = "...."
    d = yaml.load(yaml_str, Loader=yaml.FullLoad)

    # **d unpacks the dictionary produced by yaml and
    # passes them in has keyword arguments.

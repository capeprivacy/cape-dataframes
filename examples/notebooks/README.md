# Jupyter Notebooks: Working Examples for Cape Python

`cape-privacy` gives you the ability to apply several masking techniques (transformations) such as tokenization, perturbation, rounding, etc., in order to obfuscate personal information contained in your dataset. You can find out more by visiting [our documentation](https://docs.capeprivacy.com/libraries/cape-python/).

## Notebook Overview

There are several posts related to these Jupyter notebooks to assist you in evaluating the code and privacy considerations. The related policy files can be found in the `policy` folder in this `examples` folder. You will find links to the datasets in the individual notebooks. Note that some datasets are reused, so you might need to download only once.

### Cape Core: Introduction to Collaborative Privacy and Security Policy

This [overview of Cape Core software]() walks you through the use of Cape Core alongside Cape Privacy. It is a great way to get started with managing your transformations in a responsible way. Cape Core allows you to store policies centrally and coordinate them with your data science and machine learning peers. There are two notebooks related to this blog post:

- [Cape Policy for Pandas - IoT Example](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape-python/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Cape%20Policy%20for%20Pandas%20-%20IoT%20Example.ipynb)
- [Cape Policy for Spark - IoT Example](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cape-python/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Cape%20Policy%20for%20Spark%20-%20IoT%20Example.ipynb)

### Coiled Science Thursdays: Data Privacy in Distributed Data Science

The Cape team was invited to join in on [Coiled](https://coiled.io/)'s Science Thursdays to show how [Cape Python can help add privacy to distributed data science](https://coiled.io/blog/data-privacy-distributed-compute.html). This [live webinar (recording available)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIvv8EGMDY0&feature=youtu.be) walks you through the use of Cape Privacy in Spark and Pandas. There are two notebooks related to [this recording and
